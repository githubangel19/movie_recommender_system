# movie_recommender_system
A movie recommendation system, or a movie recommender system, is an ML-based approach to filtering or predicting the users film preferences based on their past choices and behavior. Itâ€™s an advanced filtration mechanism that predicts the possible movie choices of the concerned user and their preferences towards a domain-specific item, aka movie.
The basic concept behind a movie recommendation system is quite simple. In particular, there are two main elements in every recommender system: users and items.
Movie recommendation systems use a set of different filtration strategies and algorithms to help users find the most relevant films. The most popular categories of the ML algorithms used for movie recommendations include content-based filtering and collaborative filtering systems.
This project is based on content based filtering
The recommendation system analyzes the past preferences of the user concerned, and then it uses this information to try to find similar movies. This information is available in the database (e.g., lead actors, director, genre, etc.).
